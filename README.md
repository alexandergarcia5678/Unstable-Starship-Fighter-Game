# Unstable-Starship-Fighter-Game

You are a pilot of a dammaged space-ship. Every action from accelerating, to shooting, to colliding with anything causes your engine to become more unstable. Push it too far and you’re dead.

This game was made GameMaker Studio 2 for the Ludum Dare 49 Game Jam, the theme of which was "unstable". That website gave me trouble so I couldn't actually enter, but I have to post this somewhere anyway because I'm proud.

This is the first game I’ve ever made. It’s really just a prototype, but I’m very proud of what I did in this one weekend thanks to the tutorials out there and the work that I’ve put into learning GMS2

I didn’t get to include things I wanted, such as sound, but that’s probably to be expected out of a first game made in a weekend.

I would really appreciate any feedback - positive or negative - that anyone may have on improvements I can make and things I could learn in game design.

All assets were designed and created by Alex Garcia.

I learned to code on-line from Shaun Spalding, SamSpade, Daniel Shiffman, RefresherTowel, and others that post on the gamemaker forums, thank you to that great community!
